## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `"./ui-kit.css"` package export (`dist/ui-kit.css`), documented as the fallback
  integration path for consumers not running their own Tailwind CSS v4 build.
  Previously the file was built but had no `exports` map entry, so
  `import '@ravn/ui-kit/ui-kit.css'` threw `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.
- `sideEffects` field in `package.json` so bundlers that respect it can
  tree-shake unused component modules; scoped to `*.css` since the token/theme
  imports are this package's only real side effects.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

### Changed

- `README.md` and `src/styles/introduction.mdx` now document both CSS
  integration paths (`theme.css` for Tailwind consumers, `ui-kit.css` as the
  fallback) instead of only the `theme.css` step, which alone leaves a
  non-Tailwind consumer with zero component styling.
- Declaration-file generation now uses `vite-plugin-dts`'s `rollupTypes: true`
  to produce a single bundled `dist/index.d.ts`, and the separate
  `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly` build step has been removed. Previously both
  `vite-plugin-dts` and the `tsc` pass independently mirrored the full `src/`
  tree into `dist/src/**/*.d.ts` (including `.stories.d.ts`/`.test.d.ts` files
  and a leaked `dist/.storybook/decorators.d.ts`), inflating the published
  package to 82 files / 260.9 kB. The published package now ships 6 files.
- **Breaking:** renamed the `Modal` module's `useModal` convenience hook to
  `useModalState`. It never conflicted with react-aria's own `useModal` hook at
  runtime (the real one wasn't imported), but now that `Modal` itself uses
  `useModalOverlay` — which composes react-aria's `useModal` — keeping the name
  was confusing API surface.

### Fixed

- `Modal` now uses react-aria's `useModalOverlay` instead of composing
  `useOverlay` + `useDialog` directly. Background page content is now
  `inert`/`aria-hidden` to assistive tech while a modal is open, and body
  scroll is locked — neither happened before, so a screen reader or keyboard
  user could still reach content behind an open dialog.
