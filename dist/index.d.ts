/**
 * The kit's shared colour vocabularies.
 *
 * ## The problem this fixes
 *
 * Four small colour-ish string unions had grown up independently, and two of them used
 * the *same words* for different things:
 *
 * | Component(s)                                   | Union                                                     |
 * | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `Button` / `TextButton`                        | `'primary' \| 'secondary'`                                 |
 * | `Tag` / `TaskCard.tags` / `TaskTableRow.tags`  | `'primary' \| 'secondary' \| 'tertiary' \| 'neutral' \| 'blue'` |
 * | `Badge`                                        | `'neutral' \| 'success' \| 'warning' \| 'danger'`          |
 * | due-date urgency                               | `'normal' \| 'warning' \| 'overdue'`                       |
 *
 * `variant="primary"` on a `Button` meant *this is the primary action* (and happens to
 * be red). `variant="primary"` on a `Tag` meant *this chip is red*. Nothing in either
 * name said which system you were in, so moving between them meant relearning. The tag
 * union was internally inconsistent too — `primary`/`secondary`/`tertiary` are rank
 * words sitting next to `blue`, which is a colour — and `warning` meant two unrelated
 * things depending on whether you were on a `Badge` or a due date.
 *
 * ## The fix, and what deliberately did *not* change
 *
 * These are genuinely three different axes, so collapsing them into one union would
 * have been wrong. Instead each axis gets one named, exported, documented type, and no
 * word is reused across two of them:
 *
 * - `AccentColor` — "which of the palette's accent colours is this", named the way the
 *   design names it.
 * - `StatusTone` — "what does this state mean", on the design's separate status ramp.
 * - `DueDateUrgency` — the one domain-specific status the kit models directly.
 *
 * `Button`/`TextButton`'s `variant` is **not** in this file on purpose. It is Figma's
 * own "Property 1" on the "Button" COMPONENT_SET (Primary/Secondary), an action-
 * hierarchy axis whose colour is a consequence rather than the point. Folding it in
 * here would recreate exactly the collision this file exists to remove.
 */
/**
 * A categorical accent colour: which of the palette's accent hues a chip, tag or
 * indicator is painted in, with no meaning attached to the choice.
 *
 * Named by colour rather than by ramp position because that is how the design itself
 * names them — Figma's "Tag" COMPONENT_SET carries a `Type` property whose values are
 * literally `General`/`Green`/`Blue`/`Yellow`/`Red` (Tags00.md, Tags01.md). The kit
 * previously renamed those to `neutral`/`secondary`/`blue`/`tertiary`/`primary`, which
 * both obscured the source and collided with `Button`'s hierarchy words. The consuming
 * app independently arrived at the same colour-named vocabulary for its own `Tag`
 * (`'green' | 'amber' | 'blue' | 'red' | 'neutral'`), which is corroboration rather
 * than coincidence.
 *
 * Each value maps to a verified ramp token, confirmed against `Tags01.md`:
 *
 * | Value     | Figma `Type` | Token         | Hex       |
 * | --------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- |
 * | `neutral` | General      | `neutral-2`   | `#94979A` |
 * | `red`     | Red          | `primary-4`   | `#DA584B` |
 * | `green`   | Green        | `secondary-4` | `#70B252` |
 * | `yellow`  | Yellow       | `tertiary-4`  | `#E5B454` |
 * | `blue`    | Blue         | `blue`        | `#2F61BF` |
 *
 * Note `red` is `primary-4`, **not** the `danger` ramp — those are two different reds
 * (`#DA584B` vs `#E82F39`) and the design uses the former for tags. Anything conveying
 * an error state wants `StatusTone`, not this.
 */
export declare type AccentColor = 'neutral' | 'red' | 'green' | 'yellow' | 'blue';

/**
 * AddTaskModal
 *
 * Figma: "Add Task Modal" COMPONENT (`Mockups/Dashboard Add Task/Add Task Modal00-06.md`,
 * cross-checked against the in-context instance in `Components/Task Column01.md`). This is an
 * inline widget (578×184, neutral-3 bg, 8px radius) composited directly into a Task Column, not
 * a centered dialog — no backdrop, no header/close button, so unlike the other modals in this
 * folder it does not use the shared `Modal` shell. Anatomy: a borderless title input (Desktop/
 * Body/XL/bold, 20px, neutral-2 placeholder) and a "Tags" row of 4 trigger chips (Estimate/
 * Assignee/Label/Due date, in that order), and a Cancel/Create Task button pair. Live Figma
 * access (Chunk 25) confirmed the row has exactly one previously-unimplemented trigger — "Label"
 * (icon `remix-icons/fill/finance/price-tag-3-fill`), sitting between Assignee and Due date —
 * correcting the earlier claim of "two remaining ground-truth chip slots... with no legible
 * glyph." Only the trigger's icon/text/position are Figma-confirmed; its popover (`LabelModal`)
 * has no captured anatomy and is an engineering-only addition — see that component's own doc
 * comment.
 *
 * Row 2's unfilled trigger chips render as the real muted "Tag" component (`bg: rgba(148,151,154,.1)`
 * = neutral-2/10%, exactly `Tag`'s solid/neutral style) — confirmed by pixel match. Once a value is
 * picked, the spec drops that background entirely (plain icon+text on the modal's own neutral-3
 * surface); the primary Create button's disabled color (title empty) is `primary-2`, its enabled
 * color is `primary-4` — already exactly `TextButton`'s existing disabled/enabled primary styling
 * (Chunk 4), so `isDisabled={!title.trim()}` reproduces the empty-vs-typed contrast for free.
 *
 * `Mockups/Dashboard Edit Task/Add  Task Modal00.md` (note: source filename has a double
 * space) reuses this exact same "Add Task Modal" component (identical 578×184/neutral-3/8px
 * anatomy) reopened with the Estimate ("0 Points") and Assignee ("Jerome Bell") triggers
 * already filled — confirming Edit is this same widget pre-populated, not a distinct
 * component. `defaultTitle`/`defaultDueDate`/`defaultPoints`/`defaultAssignee`/`defaultLabel`
 * (all optional, defaulting to the prior blank-create behavior) seed the internal state for
 * that reuse — re-read every time the widget is reopened, not only on first mount, because
 * `isOpen` gates rendering below the hooks and therefore never unmounts the state.
 *
 * They were `initial*` until 0.4.0. The kit's prefix for an uncontrolled seed is `default*`
 * everywhere else (`defaultValue`, `defaultSelected`, `defaultSelectedKey`, `defaultOpen`),
 * following React Aria, and one component spelling it differently is a reason to check the
 * source rather than trust the pattern. The semantics are the `default*` ones: read at open,
 * then owned by the field — this widget's open is its mount, since a closed one renders
 * nothing.

 * Mockup.md` (the only ground-truth signal that resolves which of the two
 * component-doc exports is the real desktop size).
 *
 * `01.md`'s "Sidebar" (232×836, `neutral.4` #2C2F33, `border-radius: 24px`,
 * logo top:12px, "Sidebar Tab List" starting at top:96px) matches the
 * Dashboard Mockup's Sidebar layer property-for-property (same width,
 * height, radius, and offsets). `00.md`'s "Sidebar" (310×844, no
 * border-radius, logo top:36px, tab list top:120px) never appears in any
 * real desktop screen — its only other occurrences are `SideBarItem00.md`
 * (already flagged in Chunk 8 as Android/iOS mobile-breakpoint noise) and

 * sidebar width, not a second real desktop variant — no `size` prop here,
 * matching the single-size precedent Chunk 8 set for the mobile-vs-desktop
 * split on SidebarItem's source files.
 *
 * No export — the isolated component doc, the in-context Dashboard Mockup,
 * or any other mockup file — shows a footer/user-profile row anywhere
 * inside the Sidebar's bounds; the only Avatar near this layout belongs to
 * the Top Nav bar (Chunk 10's scope), not the sidebar. A previously-added
 * `footer` prop had zero ground-truth basis and zero real consumers in this
 * codebase — removed as fabricated, same treatment Chunk 4 gave Button's

 * AppShell

 * Not a named Figma component — the shared page scaffold evidenced by two
 * independent, pixel-identical real mockups: `Mockups/Dashboard Default
 * View/Dashboard Mockup.md` and `Mockups/Task Default View/My Task Mockup.md`
 * both place `Sidebar` (`left:32 top:32`), the `Search Bar`/`TopNav`
 * (`left:296 top:32 right:36 h:64` — flush against the sidebar with the same
 * 32px gap as the page's own left margin), a "Top Bar" row (`top:128 h:48`,
 * `justify-content:space-between`, containing the `Swicter` view-switcher and
 * a lone primary-filled icon `Button`), and the page's main content
 * (`Frame 654`'s Task List View row / the "Table View" list) 16-24px below
 * that — at the exact same offsets on both pages. That page-shell repetition
 * (not a single named component, but a real, consistent composition) is what
 * this promotes into a thin, exported layout — per-component audits (Chunks
 * 8-10) only ever verified `ApplicationSidebar`/`TopNav` in isolation and
 * never cross-checked their combined page position, which is this chunk's
 * (Chunk 17) job.
 *
 * The outer 36px-vs-32px right/left margin asymmetry only exists because the
 * source canvas is a fixed 1440px frame; a fluid page has no equivalent
 * "right edge" to measure against, so this uses one uniform 32px page
 * padding (`p-8`) rather than fabricating a fixed 1440px-wide breakpoint —
 * the same "canvas-fit noise, not a real constraint" judgment call Chunk 7
 * made for Tabs' `px-5`.

 *
 * **The ring's colour is `--color-interactive-text` (`primary-2`), not the brand
 * `primary-4`, and this is the one place in the kit where that swap is not about text.**
 * Every ring here is `outline-offset-2`, so it is drawn *clear of* the control, on the
 * container — it has exactly one adjacent colour, and 1.4.11 wants 3:1 against it.
 * `primary-4` manages 4.02:1 on the shell and 3.51:1 on a panel but only **2.86:1** on
 * `surface-overlay`, which is a modal or a popover: precisely where a form is most likely
 * to be, and where losing the focus indicator costs the most. `primary-2` clears all
 * three at 5.43 / 6.67 / 7.63:1.
 *
 * Nothing was traded for it. The design file draws **no focus state anywhere** — the ring
 * is an engineering addition to begin with, so unlike the primary fill below there was no
 * Figma pairing to deviate from. The caveat worth knowing: `primary-2` measures 2.02:1 on
 * white, so a consumer placing a kit control on a light container must override it. No
 * kit surface is light — `Input` and `Datepicker`'s white interiors are *inside* the
 * field, and `outline-offset-2` puts the ring on the dark container outside them.
 *
 * The focus ring below is `focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-interactive-text
 * focus-visible:outline-offset-2` with **no `outline-none`** in front of it, and
 * that omission is deliberate — every focusable component in this kit follows the
 * same rule. In Tailwind v4 `outline-none` compiles to
 * `--tw-outline-style: none; outline-style: none`, and `outline-2` compiles to
 * `outline-style: var(--tw-outline-style); outline-width: 2px`. So pairing them
 * makes the ring resolve to `outline-style: none` and never paint — the width and
 * colour are computed but draw nothing. (This is a v3→v4 behaviour change:
 * v3's `outline-none` meant "transparent 2px ring", which is now `outline-hidden`
 * and sets the same variable, so it is not the fix either.) Left off, the
 * `@property --tw-outline-style` initial value of `solid` applies and the ring
 * renders. Do not "tidy up" by adding `outline-none` back.
 *
 * This was shipped broken across 21 components and found only when the consuming
 * app migrated its task-card menu onto this kit's `Menu` and lost the visible
 * focus indicator on the sole entry point to Edit/Delete — a utility-layer
 * `outline-none` also outranks a consumer's own `@layer base :focus-visible`
 * rule, so it suppressed the app's global ring too.

 * DatePickerMenu
 *
 * Deliberately has **no `error`/`description`/`isRequired` surface**, unlike `Input`,
 * `Datepicker`, `Select`, `MultiSelect` and `LabelCheckbox`. It is a floating calendar
 * panel with no label and no trigger of its own — the consumer owns the trigger and
 * passes a `triggerRef`. A validation message rendered inside this popover would sit in a
 * surface that disappears the moment the user dismisses it, and would be announced from a
 * `role="dialog"` rather than from the field it belongs to. The error belongs on whatever
 * field owns the trigger; wrap that in `FormField` (or use `Datepicker`, which is the
 * text-input variant and takes `error` directly).
 *
 * Figma: "DatePicker / Menu" component (Components/Datepicker.md), confirmed as the real desktop
 * component via 3 real in-context instances (Mockups/Task Add Task/Add Task Modal05.md,
 * Mockups/Dashboard Add Task/Add Task Modal05.md, Mockups/Dashboard Edit Task/Add Task Modal06.md)
 * -- all pixel-identical to the isolated doc export. `Date Picker.md`'s 320x472 DM-Sans "hero"
 * variant only ever appears in the mobile-Android mockup tree (out of scope) and never in any
 * desktop screen, confirming the existing `typography.mdx` note that it doesn't back a shipped
 * component -- this file is the real target.
 *
 * - 280px wide, bg-neutral-5, border-neutral-2, rounded-4 (4px), shadow-elevation (3-layer)
 * - Header: 4 nav icons (double-chevron = year, single chevron = month) flanking a centered
 *   "Month YYYY" label (SF Pro Text Semibold 14px/22px) -- the prior implementation only had
 *   month nav; year nav (DoubleLeft/DoubleRight) was missing entirely
 * - Weekday row (Sun-Sat) + a fixed 6-week grid (spec's Content frame is a fixed 226px for
 *   8px/12px padding + 7 rows @ 30px, i.e. always 6 week-rows regardless of month length)
 * - Day cells: 24x24, rounded-2 (2px), SF Pro Text Regular 14px/22px; neutral-1 for the viewed
 *   month, neutral-2 for lead/trail days from adjacent months
 * - The single real highlighted-cell instance in spec is a 1px solid primary-4 border,
 *   rounded-2 -- no filled/bg-primary-4 cell instance exists anywhere in the export. The prior
 *   implementation had two competing unverified treatments (bg-primary-4 "selected" + bordered
 *   "today"); resolved to the one verified treatment (border only) applied to the selected date.
 * - Two full-width 1px neutral-2 dividers (header/content, content/footer) were missing entirely.
 * - Footer: centered text-only button, primary-4, SF Pro Text Regular 14px/22px, with a
 *   permanently-hidden ("display: none") search icon slot. Confirmed via direct Figma
 *   inspection (Dev Mode "Content" field, not just the layer's name -- the static CSS export
 *   only captured the layer name "Button" and couldn't distinguish it from actual rendered
 *   text) that the button's real content is literally "Today", matching the "jump to today"
 *   behavior already implemented -- this was a correct guess, now a confirmed fact.
 *
 * Accessibility: built on the shared `Popover` primitive (see that file's doc comment) plus
 * react-stately's `useCalendarState` + react-aria's `useCalendar`/`useCalendarGrid`/
 * `useCalendarCell` for the day grid — previously a fully hand-rolled 42-individually-tabbed-
 * button grid with no `role="grid"`/`role="gridcell"` and no arrow-key navigation. The month-nav
 * chevrons use `useCalendar`'s `prevButtonProps`/`nextButtonProps`; the year-nav chevrons (which
 * react-aria's calendar hooks have no built-in equivalent for) call
 * `state.focusPreviousSection(true)`/`focusNextSection(true)` directly, the same "jump by the
 * next larger unit" primitive `Shift+PageUp`/`Shift+PageDown` use internally.
 *
 * One deliberate behavior change from adopting real calendar semantics: lead/trail days from
 * adjacent months (`isOutsideMonth`) are now non-interactive (not focusable, not selectable) —
 * react-aria's `useCalendarCell` treats `isOutsideMonth` cells as disabled by design, matching
 * how most calendar widgets treat context-only adjacent-month days. Previously every one of the
 * 42 cells was independently clickable/selectable regardless of month; that was never confirmed
 * against Figma (only the dimmed *styling* of those cells is spec'd), so trading it for
 * correct, standard grid semantics is a net accessibility improvement, not a regression against
 * verified spec.

 * Styling for a *visible* field label.
 *
 * Most fields should not use it. The design draws **no field labels at all** — not in the
 * Add/Edit Task modal, not on the search bar, nowhere across 100 export files. A field's
 * own text carries its meaning: the placeholder in the empty state, the value in the
 * filled one. So `isLabelVisible` defaults to `false` on every control and the label
 * renders `sr-only`, which keeps the accessible name without inventing visual chrome.
 *
 * When a consumer does opt in, this is the design's real spec for a small label on a dark
 * surface — the sidebar's `PROJECTS` header (`Dashboard Mockup.md:237-254`): 15px / 600 /
 * 0.75px tracking, which is exactly `--text-body-m`.
 *
 * **The colour is a deliberate deviation, and the ratio is why.** That header's own colour
 * is `#94979A` (`neutral-2`), but it sits on `#2C2F33`, where it measures 4.58:1. On the
 * `#393D41` modal card — where a task form actually lives — the same pairing is
 * **3.73:1**, under AA. `#FFFFFF` is the only other colour the design ever puts on a dark
 * surface, and it clears AA on all three: 10.95:1 on overlay, 13.45:1 on panel, 15.40:1
 * on shell. (The overlay figure read 11.60:1 here until it was recomputed; the conclusion
 * is unchanged, but a contrast comment carrying a wrong number is worth less than none.)
 *
 * This was `text-field-label font-semibold text-neutral-3 uppercase`, which was invented
 * twice over: `#393D41` measured **1.41:1** on the shell — the design uses it as a
 * background 55 times and as a border 283 times, and as text zero times — at 12px, a size

 * FloatingPopover
 *
 * A second, deliberately separate popover primitive from `./popover.tsx`'s
 * `Popover` — not a mode flag on it. `Popover` (Section 2 of
 * `MIGRATION_GAPS.md`) is explicitly non-portalled and CSS-anchored
 * (`absolute` inside a `relative` wrapper), which is the right shape for the
 * modal-shaped popovers it serves (`AssigneeModal`/`EstimateModal`/
 * `LabelModal`/`DatePickerMenu`) but the wrong shape for a dropdown: those
 * anchor inside layout contexts (a filter bar, a table cell) that routinely
 * clip `overflow: hidden`, and CSS `absolute` positioning can't escape that
 * ancestor no matter how the z-index is tuned. `Select`/`MultiSelect` need
 * real anchored-floating positioning that survives being clipped —
 * react-aria's `usePopover` + `Overlay` (portal to `document.body`, flip when
 * there's no room, track the trigger's position) — which is a different
 * enough contract (portalled vs. not, position-tracking vs. not) that
 * overloading `Popover` with an `isPortalled` flag would leave every consumer
 * of that component branching on a mode instead of picking the primitive
 * that already matches their layout.
 *
 * The two `DismissButton`s are visually-hidden bookend controls giving
 * assistive-tech users an explicit way to close the popover from either end
 * of its content, matching `Popover`'s reasoning.
 *
 * Wrapped in `FocusScope restoreFocus` (no `autoFocus` here, unlike
 * `Popover`'s — initial focus placement is left to whichever composing
 * component renders inside, e.g. `ListBox`/`MenuList`'s own `autoFocus`)
 * so closing returns focus to the trigger that opened it, matching
 * `Popover`'s same restoration for the non-portalled family. Without it,
 * closing removes the focused option/item from the DOM and the browser
 * drops focus to `<body>` instead.
 *

 * Escape is handled here in the capture phase rather than left to
 * `usePopover`'s own dismissal for two reasons found by driving this in a
 * real browser rather than trusting jsdom: `ListBox` binds Escape for its
 * own purposes (clearing selection) and stops the event there, so a
 * bubble-phase handler on this element never sees it and the popover stays
 * open; and because this popover is portalled to the end of `<body>`, React
 * still replays the event up the *component* tree, so an Escape that did get
 * through would also reach whatever dialog rendered the trigger and close
 * both layers at once. Capturing before the list gets the event, then
 * stopping propagation after closing, makes Escape dismiss exactly the
 * topmost layer.

/**
 * The kit's icon vocabulary.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Icon *slots* (`SidebarItemProps.icon`, `TagProps.icon`, `TaskMetaBadge.icon`, ...) are
 * typed `React.ReactNode`, which pushed the entire glyph vocabulary onto the consumer:
 * the kit shipped zero icons while baking ad-hoc `<svg>` literals into eleven of its own
 * components, and the consuming app maintained a seventeenth-of-its-own set in parallel.
 * The two drifted — the kit's local `AlarmIcon` was a hand-drawn clock, the app's is the
 * design's actual `alarm-line` glyph — so the same concept rendered differently depending
 * on which side of the package boundary you were on. A design system that owns the slots
 * has to own the glyphs too.
 *
 * ## Provenance
 *
 * Three tiers, and every icon below says which one it is. Do not blur them.
 *
 * 1. **Figma-exported** — the `d` attribute is the design's own SVG export, verbatim. The
 *    consuming app keeps those raw exports in `src/ui/icons/assets/*.svg` for byte-level
 *    comparison; the path data here was carried across unchanged.
 * 2. **Reconstructed from Figma layout metrics** — no path export exists, but the design
 *    file records the glyph's box, stroke width and percentage insets, so the geometry is
 *    derived rather than guessed. The comment shows the numbers it was derived from.
 * 3. **No Figma source** — an engineering addition for a control the design never drew.
 *    Stated plainly, with why it exists anyway.
 *
 * Where a glyph resolves to a named `remix-icons` component in the Figma file, that name
 * is recorded. (The design is built on remix-icons; `UI_KIT_MASTER_PLAN.md` Chunks 24/25
 * established this, and the per-component CSS exports name several of them outright.)
 *
 * ## Two things change on the way in from Figma, both deliberate
 *
 * - The baked `fill` becomes `currentColor`, so colour comes from the token layer instead
 *   of being frozen at export time. The design ships the alarm glyph twice, once white and
 *   once red, purely because a fill cannot be overridden; here that is one icon and a text
 *   colour.
 * - Nothing else. In particular the artboard is **not** normalised to a square viewBox.
 *   Most of these glyphs are non-square (`0 0 18 4`, `0 0 20.506 19.253`, ...) and are
 *   kept exactly as the design draws them, because `preserveAspectRatio` defaults to
 *   `xMidYMid meet`: a caller setting `size-6` gets the glyph scaled to fit a 24x24 box
 *   with its own aspect ratio and padding intact, which is what the design intends. Each
 *   icon's comment records the box the design places it in.
 *
 *   Normalising every viewBox to a square was considered and rejected: it would make
 *   `size-*` optically uniform across the set, but it also silently rescales every glyph
 *   at every existing call site, which turns a mechanical import swap into a visual diff
 *   nobody asked for. Uniformity is not worth re-tuning sizes across two repos.
 *
 * ## Sizing
 *
 * The caller's job, via `className` — `size-4`, `size-6`, and so on. No `size` prop: these
 * are plain `<svg>` elements and Tailwind's sizing utilities already express every case,
 * so a prop would be a second, weaker way to say the same thing. Icons carry no intrinsic
 * dimensions, so an unsized icon inherits the SVG default of 300x150 — always size them.
 *
 * ## Accessibility
 *
 * Decorative by default: every icon renders `aria-hidden="true"` unless it is given an
 * accessible name. Pass `aria-label` (or `aria-labelledby`) and the icon promotes itself
 * to `role="img"` and drops the `aria-hidden`, because an icon that has been named is by
 * definition not decorative. Both can still be overridden explicitly — caller-supplied
 * props are spread last and win.
 *
 * ## One component per icon, not `<Icon name="..." />`
 *
 * A name-indexed component needs a lookup map holding every glyph, which is a single
 * module-level object every consumer imports whole — no bundler can tree-shake an unused
 * icon out of it. One export per icon keeps each glyph independently shakeable, gives the
 * consumer real autocomplete and a compile error on a typo rather than a blank render,
 * and matches how the kit's icon slots are already typed (`React.ReactNode`, i.e. you pass
 * `<PlusIcon />`, not a string).

 * `Select` that folding them into one component behind a `selectionMode`

 * `HiddenSelect` counterpart here for the same reason: a native
 * `<select multiple>` is a scrolling list box that looks nothing like this
 * design, and the control is never submitted as a form field directly — a
 * consuming form reads the selection from `onSelectionChange`.
 *
 * The selection renders as the trigger's own comma-separated value, the same
 * way `Select` renders its single one. It used to render as `Tag` chips
 * instead, which stopped making sense the moment the trigger became the
 * design's chip: a `Tag` is exactly 32px, so two of them filled a 32px
 * trigger edge to edge and the control read as two loose tags with a stray
 * chevron rather than as one field. The design agrees — every filled picker

 *   arbitrary-value class before that token existed.
 * - Segments: 0 gap between them, height 32px, padding 4px 24px, radius 8px
 *   (`rounded-sm`, which Chunk 1 redefined to 8px).
 * - Active segment: bg-neutral-2 pill + Drop Shadow Small (`shadow-small`
 *   token, Chunk 1). Text: IOS/Subheadline/S.regular -- 13px/13px,
 *   letter-spacing 1px, weight 400 -- rendered via the shared `--font-sans`
 *   token per the Chunk 1 "no separate SF Pro Text token" precedent.
 * - Inactive: same 13px/regular/neutral-1 label -- Figma shows identical
 *   (white) label color for both states, distinguishing selection purely via
 *   the pill background fill, not a text-color change. Spec also carries a
 *   `filter: drop-shadow` on the inactive pill, but that's a Figma effect on
 *   an otherwise-transparent shape with no visible box -- applying our
 *   `shadow-small` (a `box-shadow`, which always renders behind the full
 *   element box) there would draw a visible phantom rectangle that doesn't
 *   exist in the reference; intentionally omitted.
 *
 * Accessibility: this renders `role="radio"` pill `<button>`s, so per WAI-ARIA
 * they must be contained by `role="radiogroup"` (not `role="group"`, the
 * previous — invalid — wrapper role). Navigation is hand-implemented (roving
 * tabindex + arrow keys) rather than via react-aria's `useRadio`/`useRadioGroup`:
 * those hooks return `inputProps` for a real `<input type="radio">` element
 * (native radio inputs are how they get keyboard/arrow-key behavior for free),
 * which doesn't fit this component's single-`<button>`-per-segment pill shape
 * without swapping in a hidden-native-input + `<label>` structure — a
 * disruptive rewrite of the visual design for a control this small. The
 * arrow-key/roving-tabindex behavior below follows the same WAI-ARIA APG
 * radiogroup pattern those hooks implement (selection follows focus, one
 * tab stop for the whole group).

 *
 * Real anatomy: fixed 56px-tall row, `padding: 0 0 0 16px` (no right/vertical
 * padding — content is vertically centered by the fixed height), `gap: 16px`,
 * Icon Placeholder (24×24) then label (`flex-grow: 1`) then a 4px-wide,

 * edge. Label is Desktop/Body/M/bold: SF Pro Display, 15px/24px, weight 600,
 * letter-spacing 0.75px (`tracking-wider`, the Chunk 2/3 convention).
 *
 * State matrix (colors only — icon/label always share one color):
 * - Default: `neutral.2` (#94979A), no background, indicator `opacity: 0`.
 * - Hover: `primary.4` (#DA584B), still **no background** (the Hover export

 *
 * The indicator is kept mounted across all states with only its opacity
 * toggled (matching the spec, which always includes the Rectangle 33 layer)
 * rather than conditionally rendered, so it can transition in/out.

/**
 * TextButton
 *
 * Figma: "Text Button" COMPONENT_SET inside "Button, Switch Button" frame
 * (Button, Switch Button01.md). Despite the name, this is a solid-fill pill
 * (State=Default/Disable/Hover/Selected × Type=Primary/Secondary), not an
 * underline/link style. Desktop/Body/M/regular: SF Pro Display, 15px/24px,
 * weight 400, letter-spacing 0.75px (tracking-wider). Padding 8px on all
 * sides, border-radius 8px (--radius-sm).
 *
 * Note: the spec's Type=Primary "Disable" state (bg primary-2) is literally
 * identical to its "Hover" state — not a transcription error, both frames
 * use the same #EBA59E swatch.
 *
 * ## The primary variant does not meet WCAG AA, deliberately
 *
 * `text-main` on `bg-primary-4` measures **3.83:1**, under 1.4.3's 4.5:1 for normal text.
 * `isSelected`'s `bg-primary-3` is worse at **2.83:1**, and the disabled/hover
 * `bg-primary-2` worse again at 2.02:1. Fourteen of the 131 contrast violations an axe
 * pass over the built Storybook reports are this button.
 *
 * It is left as drawn, and that is a different call from the ones `Tag`, `Badge` and
 * `Avatar` took in the same pass. Those all had somewhere to go. This does not:
 *
 * - **No label colour fixes it.** The best dark option in the whole palette is
 *   `neutral-5` at 4.02:1, still short. Only near-black would clear it, and the palette
 *   has no black — `neutral-5` (#222528) is the darkest thing in it.
 * - **No fill in the ramp fixes it either.** `primary-4` is the ramp's darkest step;
 *   1, 2 and 3 are all lighter and measure worse against white.
 * - So the only fix is a **new, darker red that Figma does not contain**. Continuing the
 *   ramp's own arithmetic (-9/-39/-42 per step) lands on `#D13323`, which would clear
 *   4.99:1 — and CONTRIBUTING.md's first design value is that no value is invented or
 *   approximated. Changing it would also either leave two different reds side by side
 *   (this button next to an icon `Button`, a focus ring, `Tag`'s red) or repaint
 *   `--color-primary-4` itself, which is every brand surface in both repos.
 *
 * This is the one case in this kit where the design has a definite opinion that fails AA,
 * as opposed to being silent. The error-colour precedent does not transfer: the design
 * draws no error state at all, so that ramp step was a free choice constrained only by
 * contrast. Here it is the brand's own CTA.
 *
 * `contrast.test.ts` asserts the current state so it cannot be mistaken for passing, and
 * `MIGRATION_GAPS.md` tracks it as the open item it is. The **icon** `Button`'s
 * `variant="primary"` uses the same fill and is *not* affected: an icon is non-text, so
 * 1.4.11's 3:1 applies to it and 3.83:1 clears that.

 *
 * Confirmed via live Figma access (node 82:2742, fileKey ZUAB3jXFyKFktoAzvN7h1T) after
 * shipping with an unverified guess: Property 1=Default vs Property 1=Selected differ
 * structurally — Frame 648 is 88px wide (bell icon + avatar) in Default, 136px (close icon +

 * icon in Selected is a literal close/X glyph — confirming the clear-search interpretation
 * this component already shipped with. One real correction from the live check: the close
 * icon is the FIRST child of the trailing group in Selected, not appended after the bell
 * icon as previously implemented — order is close (when shown), then bell, then avatar.
 * Not yet re-verified: whether the real trigger is strictly "focused" vs this component's
 * "has a non-empty value" (Selected's cursor glyph doesn't prove which) — kept the
 * value-based trigger since showing a clear button with nothing to clear is the weaker UX
