# PreToolUse(Bash) — refuse a short list of irreversible commands.
#
# The tool call arrives as JSON on stdin; the command is `.tool_input.command`.
# There is no positional argument and no environment variable carrying it — the
# only ones a hook is given are CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT,
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA and CLAUDE_EFFORT. The first version of this file opened
# with `COMMAND="$1"`, so COMMAND was always the empty string, no pattern ever
# matched, and it exited 0 on `rm -rf /` from 7514d38 — the commit that
# installed it — onward: present, running, and completely inert. Nothing in
# `npm run gate` could see the difference, which is why `scripts/hooks.test.mjs`
# now pins both halves — that the payload is read from stdin, and that a match
# is refused rather than merely logged.
#
# Refusing is a JSON decision on stdout, not a non-zero exit. A bare `exit 1` is
# a *non-blocking* error: Claude Code surfaces it and then runs the command
# anyway. (`exit 2` does block, but it addresses the model rather than the user,
# and any JSON printed alongside it is ignored.)
#
# `node`, not `jq`, parses the payload. Every step of `npm run gate` — tsc,
# eslint, prettier, vitest — is a Node program, so a checkout that cannot run
# `node` cannot run this repo at all; `jq` is a system package `npm install`
# never provides, and a safety hook whose parser is missing on somebody else's
# machine is the same silent no-op this file is being fixed out of. (The
# consuming app makes the same argument from its `engines.node`. This package
# deliberately declares none — it ships browser components, so a Node floor in
# its manifest would assert a constraint on consumers that is not real. The
# argument above does not need one.)
